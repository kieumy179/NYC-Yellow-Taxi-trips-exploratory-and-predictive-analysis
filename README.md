- Created storage bucket and loaded data in Google Cloud, wrote SQL queries to clean and do exploratory analysis to gain insights of taxi trips business (30+ million rows).

- Checked the Cluster dashboard to monitor the resource change for each query execution.

- Built a regression model by using Pyspark machine learning libraries to predict tip amount for each trip with some basic features such as the number of passengers, trip distance and trip cost.

- Did different performance tuning techniques for code optimization, made comparison among each method and combinations of them in terms of running time.
